# McGill Event Calendar

## Background
We wanted to make a calendar where students at McGill can easily find events happening around campus by student societies and clubs. We figured that all the student clubs and societies have their own Facebook pages and it takes too much work to figure out every event happening. Our website makes it easy for students to quickly find events happening and enables them to quickly sign up for them by providing a link to the Facebook listing for that event.

## Development
Our backend is done in Python using the Django framework. The frontend is JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
